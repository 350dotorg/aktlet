AKTlet: the Actionkit Raplet
============================

AKTlet lets you install and host your own Actionkit Raplet
(Rapportive.com plugin) so that your organization's staff can
view topline Actionkit information from their GMail sidebar when
corresponding with your members.

Features include:

 * A secure, self-hosted Raplet for your own Actionkit data
 * Full control over user accounts for who can access the Raplet's
   data
 * Information about members' subscription status, donation and action
   totals, signup date, and latest activity appears in the GMail
   sidebar by default
 * Fully configurable through the web -- write custom SQL to pull any
   data about an Actionkit member if the defaults aren't what you
   need, and use Django Templates, HTML and CSS to customize the
   Raplet's display. 

Installation instructions for Heroku can be found in the INSTALL.txt
file.
